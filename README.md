## Project Description

The project is a code snippet manager made for multiple different languages which
allows searching, comparison, and copying. This is to provide a portal for
developers with an easy and quick interface to reference commonly used snippets
and to help learn them in other languages. Some stretch goals include: Custom
Snippets (User defined), a CLI interface for those weirdos who use CLI too much,
and a long stretch goal of extending past code snippets.
