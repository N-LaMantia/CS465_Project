# DESIGN

## Project Motivation

This application is intended to serve as a reference for anyone programming
without a snippet manager. The goal is to get a unified resource for programming
snippets and to allow comparison between languages.

## Project Parts

  why are you doing it? Who will it benefit (students, senior citizens, teachers,
  disabled, travelers, etc.)

### Nicholas

- Feature 3 (display languages based on the selected snippet).
- Feature 4 (a drop-down menu of all languages).
- Any front-end work that comes with the features above.

### Matt

- Application UI wireframes
- Allow user to copy snippet code through highlighting or a copy button

### Jace
 -  feature 1
 -  feature 6
 -  other things as needed

## External Data Sources

- We will use external documentation to write snippets to include in our project.
  - This will not be during runtime, but we may include links to documentation
    to provide more information to the user.
